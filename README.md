==========


Async Spreedly payment service client library.  Wraps external requests in Futures and parses XML into domain transfer objects.


## Usage
Include as a dependency in `build.sbt`
```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.ticketfly" %% "spreedly-client" % "1.1.0"
```


Exposes `SpreedlyClient` which is the core interaction class for performing REST actions against payment gateways.  It marshals success & error responses into Spreedly DTOs.

[JAXB](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/ScalaWS) is recommended by Typesafe as an efficient way to serialize XML over the wire.  The mappings are largely from [spreedly-java](https://github.com/rjstanford/spreedly-java) (MIT license).

```scala
import com.ticketfly.spreedly._

val config = SpreedlyConfiguration("environmentToken", "accessSecret")
val spreedlyClient = new SpreedlyClient(config)

// Make a purchase of $1 using a gateway token and payment method token
spreedlyClient.purchase("gaToken", "pmToken", 100, "USD").map(response => {
    if (response.succeeded) log.info(s"Successfully completed purchase with token ${response.getToken}")
    else log.error(s"Could not complete purchase, response errors: ${response.errors.toString}")
}) recover {
    case e: SpreedlyException => {
      log.error(s"Error contacting Spreedly service: ${e.getMessage}")
      throw e
    }
}
```


## Test
```
sbt clean coverage test
```


### Terminology
#### Authorize & Capture
An *authorize* call will contact the gateway to verify whether a transaction can take place and funds can be transferred.
If able to proceed, a *capture* is then required to perform the fund transfer.

#### Purchase
Immediately transfer funds through payment gateway if transaction is approved.

#### Redact
In most cases, Spreedly will not permit you to delete resources (gateway accounts, payments, etc) since their history is permanent.
Instead, they allow you to *redact* these resources, making them inactive and scrubbing them of sensitive information.
Spreedly will not charge storage fees for redacted resources.

#### Retain
By default, payment methods are created and their tokens are short-lived, expiring after a few minutes.
Gateway accounts, however, are automatically *retained* by default when called via normal, authenticated channel.
Spreedly allows you to *retain* customer payment methods by an explicit API call or by passing a `retain_on_success` to purchase, verify, or authorize calls.

#### Recache
Certain sensitive data such as credit card CVV cannot be retained by Spreedly.
Instead, they can be *recached* for a period of time in order to maintain the original payment method and its token.

#### Credit
A transaction *credit* is the same as a refund.

#### Void
Cancel a charge that hasn't yet taken place by issuing a *void*.
